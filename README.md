# python-git-crypt

python-git-crypt Docker image providing and git-crypt to decrypt files.

The motivation behind the image was to have a ready docker file to build Python projects using git-crypt on repository files.

Tools provided by image initial version: bash, g++, make, libffi-dev, openssl, git, gnupg, libssl-dev, gnupg-agent

Build docker build -t KeymakerDI/python-git-crypt .

Usage The image is expected to be run inside a (build) pipeline, which should handle setting getting git-crypt and enabling user to send in GPG secret / public via pipeline job.

You may write a shell script to use gpg for unattended access to the git-crypt repository. It is highly recommended to use a user that only has access to your repository due to the fact that someone might get hands on your secrets.

Variable names used for GPG:

GPG_PASSPHRASE

The entrypoint is set to /bin/sh.
